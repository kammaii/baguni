    <string name="NUMBERS_INTRO_TITLE">How to say numbers in Korean</string>
    <string name="NUMBERS_INTRO">"Many Korean learners think Korean numbers are really difficult.
Because there are two systems of Korean numbers(Sino-Korean number / Native-Korean number) and you should use each number system depending on what the number is used for.
Therefore whenever students say numbers, they are confused about which system of number to use.

In general, each number system is used in the following situations:

1. Sino-Korean number: Number itself
2. Native-Korean number: Counting numbers (that's why we should use this with an 'unit noun' together)

But when you learn Korean numbers, you can see that this rule is not always correct.
(For example, why the hour is Native-Korean number but the minute is Sino-Korean number?)

So I suggest to students
'Just listen and follow the correct number a lot. Then you will feel something strange right before you try to use the wrong number.'

This lesson is designed to learn Sino-Korean number and Native-Korean number as well as to practice the numbers repeatedly in different situations.

Let's practice until '일시 오분' and '십살' seem strange!"</string>

        If you can, try to get in touch with someone else who shares your interest in learning Korean. I mostly study alone, but once a week I meet other students who are learning Korean where I live. In that way, I think that I can increase my motivation to study and make it more fun.

    <!--    스페셜레슨-->
    <string name="SL_01_CONTENTS">"Korean verbs and adjectives have a base form.
Base form ends with '~다' such as '먹다 (to eat)', '가다 (to go)' and '사다 (to buy)'.

You'll need to look up the word as a base form on a dictionary, but when you actually use a word in a conversation or writing you should transform it into the form that you want to express.
For example, '먹다 (to eat)' changes as below.

- 먹다 (to eat) : base form
- 먹어요 (I eat)
- 먹으면 (if I eat)
- 먹어서 (because I eat)
- 먹고나서 (after I eat)

Mostly you can only change the last syllable '~다' of the base form into the other form, but sometimes there are irregular words that you have to change not only '~다' but also the other syllables as well.
For example...

- 듣다 (to listen / base form)
- 들어요 (I listen)
- 들으면 (If I listen)
- 들어서(because I listen)
- 듣고나서(after I listen)

Many students think that irregular words are difficult, but you don't need to worry because most of the irregular forms are for easier pronunciation.
In the example above, you can pronounce the word easier by changing it irregularly into '들어요[드러요]' instead of '듣어요[드더요]'.
Therefore, if you use it several times through speaking practice, you will be able to remember irregular words naturally."</string>


    <string name="SL_03_CONTENTS">"The first conjugation you will learn is the '아요/어요' form(Shortly call '아/어요' form).
'아/어요' form is not too formal but can sound polite enough.
Therefore, it is used often in everyday conversation.

There are three rules to transform the base form into '아/어요'.
Let's take a look at the example. (You don't need to know the meaning of the words in the example right now. Let's focus on the process of changing the base form into '아/어요' form.)

1.

하다 -> 해요
: The base form of a verb or adjective ending with '~하다' can be simply changed to '해요'.

ex)
공부하다 -> 공부해요
운동하다 -> 운동해요
좋아하다 -> 좋아해요

2.

If the syllable before '~다' has 'ㅏ' or 'ㅗ' vowel -> '아요'
: You should check the syllable right before the '~다' In the base form.
If the syllable has 'ㅏ' or 'ㅗ' vowel, this word should be added with '아요'.
Let's take a look at the word '가다'.
The previous syllable of '다' is '가' and '가' has a vowel 'ㅏ'.
Therefore, the word '가다' is conjugated to '가' + '아요' = '가아요',
and '가아요' can be simplified to '가요'.

ex)
'오다' -> '오' + '아요' = '오아요' -> '와요'
'만나다' -> '만나' + '아요' = '만나아요' -> '만나요'
'살다' -> '살' + '아요' -> '살아요'

3.

Every word except 1 and 2 -> '어요'
: Let's look at the word '먹다.
This word doesn't end with '하다'.
And since the vowels of the '먹' is 'ㅓ', it's not fall into the type 2 as well.
Therefore, this word is type 3 and you can add '어요' after the base form.

ex)
'먹다' -> '먹' + '어요' = '먹어요'
'배우다' -> '배우' + '어요' = '배우어요' -> '배워요'
'읽다' -> '읽' + '어요' = '읽어요'

So far, we have looked at the '아/어요' and let's make a promise with me now.
Just think about this rule until Lesson 10 and forget about this.
Actually there are only a few Koreans who know this rule.
When you learn new verbs or adjectives, just take a look '아/어요' as well.
And just say '아요' or '어요' as it is pronounced comfortably. It might be correct.

I'm going to give you one more interesting thing and finish this lesson.
The '아/어요' is very powerful that it can have a various meanings depending on the way you speak or the situation.

For example, let's see the word '먹어요'.
a. "먹어요." (You eat)
b. "먹어요?" (Do you eat?)
c. "먹어요!!" (You must eat!)
There are more meanings, but let's just remember type 'a' and 'b' from above examples."</string>


    <string name="SL_04_CONTENTS">"Particles in Korean is quite hard for those students who use language which doesn't have particles.
The most difficult particles are '은/는', '이/가' and '을/를'.
We'll learn each particle later and I'm going to explain why korean use particles in this lesson.

There are two sentences in English as below.
1. I eat lion.
2. Lion eat I. (Of course, 'The lion eats me' is the correct sentence but ignore it for now)

The subject of sentence 1 is 'I' and the object is 'lion'.
However, the subject of sentence 2 is 'lion' and the object is 'I'.
In english, depending on the position of the word in the sentence structure, the subject and the object can be determined and the meanings of sentences become completely different.

Now let's look at the Korean sentence using particles.
1. 나는 사자를 먹어요
2. 사자를 나는 먹어요
In the first sentence, subject particle '는' is added after '나' meaning 'I', and object particle '를' is added after '사자' meaning 'lion' in the second sentence.
When you use particles the role of the word is fixed, so the sentence always has the same meaning no matter where you put the word.
Therefore, sentence 1 and 2 is totally same meaning as 'I eat lion'.

This is the difference between language that use particles and language does not use particles.
But it's not a good idea to change the position of words all the time.
In general Korean language structure is 'subject-object-predicate', so it would be better to follow this order."</string>


    <string name="SL_05_CONTENTS">"There are 2 basic tips to improve your pronunciation.

1. The consonant 'ㅇ' is a silent consonant(Only if it's not a Batchim).
Therefore, when there is a syllable which has a Batchim before the consonant 'ㅇ' syllable, the Batchim can replace the next syllable's consonant 'ㅇ' to read it naturally.
For example, '사람이에요' has a Batchim 'ㅁ' in the syllable '람' and the next syllable '이' has a consonant 'ㅇ' which is a silent phoneme.
So you can pronounce it like [사라미에요].

2. Batchim 'ㅎ' makes the sound of following syllable stronger.
If the syllables which composed with 'ㄱ', 'ㄷ', 'ㅈ' comes after or before the syllable with 'ㅎ', they sound like 'ㅋ', 'ㅌ', 'ㅊ' respectively.
ex)
- 좋다 -> [조타]
- 놓고 -> [노코]
- 많지 -> [만치]"</string>


    <string name="SL_06_CONTENTS">"1. 5시에 운동을 해요.
2. 5시에서 운동을 해요.

Which one is correct?

1.

You can use '~에' after the 'time/hour', so this sentence is correct.

ex)
- 5시에 운동을 해요.
- 아침에 학교를 가요.
- 저녁에 약속이 있어요.

2.

You should use '~에서' after the 'place/location' not 'time' so this sentence is incorrect.

ex)
- 학교에서 한국어를 공부해요.
- 집에서 TV를 봐요.
- 식당에서 밥을 먹어요.

It may sound easy so far. Let's learn a little further now.

2-1.

There's some case that you have to use '~에' following after a 'place/location'. When you want to talk about the existence('있다/없다') or movement('가다/오다/도착하다/다니다...'), you can use '~에' after the noun indicating the place.

ex)
- 서점에 책이 있어요.
- 밖에 사람이 없어요.
- 병원에 가요.
- 어제 한국에 도착했어요.
- 한국어 학교에 다녀요.

In a nutshell, you can use '~에' unconditionally after the noun indicating the time, and basically you can use '~에서' after the noun indicating the place.
But sometimes you can use '~에' after the noun indicating the place depending on the verb of the sentence."</string>

Does it sound right?

Restaurant is '식당' in Korean but native Korean often say 'food' + '집'(house) instead of saying 'food' + 식당(restaurant).
So above example sentences can be changed as below.

- 비빔밥집
- 스파게티집
- 떡볶이집

This way sounds more natural.
Then, how can you say Korean restaurant in Korean?
Korean food is called '한국 음식' or  shortly '한식' so you can say '한식집' or '한식당'."</string>


    <string name="SL_08_CONTENTS">"1.

As you learned in the previous lesson, '아서/어서' is a reason or cause.

- 겨울이어서 날씨가 추워요. ('이다' -> '이어서')

In '이다 -> 이어서' case, it is better to say '이라서' in the actual conversation as below
- 저거는 50% 세일이라서 5,000원이에요.
- 겨울이라서 날씨가 추워요.

2.

You can also use '아서/어서' to describe the timeline of two happenings.
In this case, there must be a close connection between what happened before and what happened afterwards.

ex)

Some people say that it's better not to use it because it's not a standard language.

However, some words are not recommended to use in a formal situation.

Below words are the most common used newly-coined words recently.

1. 인플루언서
: This is a loanword adopted  from English word 'influencer'.
'인플루언서' is an individual who has a large number of followers in social media and power to affect opinion and decisions of other people.

2. 편스토랑
: A combination of '편의점 (convenience store)' and '레스토랑 (restaurant)'.
It's a convenience store where you can have a quality meal like a restaurant.

3. 소떡소떡
: It's a Korean street food snack that  skewered alternately '소시지 (sausage)' with '떡 (rice cake)' and baked.
That's why it is called '소떡소떡'.

4. 스포
: It's from English word 'spoiler'.
It's an behavior or piece of plot that reveals critical part like ending of of the movie/drama/show.

5. 꾸안꾸
: This is an abbreviation of '꾸민 듯 안 꾸민 듯.
It means someone's outfit looks natural but not too shady and someone's make-up looks natural that you cannot tell if she/he put on a make-up or not. You can use the word like '꾸안꾸 style'(natural outfit) and
'꾸안꾸 make-up'(natural make-up)."

"You might wonder why there are Chinese character lesson.
Since Korea used Chinese characters in the past, there are lots of words made from Chinese characters.

Usually in a formal writing, the high level of vocabulary derived from Chinese character is used.
Therefore, if you don't know the words from Chinese character, you could be overwhelmed by many unfamiliar words when you start reading Korean articles.

However, because each Chinese character has its own meaning, learning a few easy Chinese characters can help you to understand the meaning of Korean words better.
Therefore, let's study a few easy Chinese characters.

The first Chinese character we will learn is '人'(사람 인).
This Chinese character has the meaning of '사람'(people) and you can read it as '인'.
The shape of this letter is also very interesting.
This letter represents a human's walking posture.
Therefore, if there is a syllable '인' in Korean word, we can guess that it is related to 'people'.

The base form of '좋아요' is '좋다'(adjective) and it can be used after the subject(which is able to use with '이/가'). But first sentence put '좋아요' after object which is incorrect, so you have to change it like '저는 스키가 좋아요'.

ex)

2.

The base form of '좋아해요' is '좋아하다'(verb) and it can be used after the object(which is able to use with '을/를'). So this sentence sounds natural.

Likewise, instead of
'이 식당은 비빔밥이 맛있어서 비빔밥 먹으세요',

Everyone can easily see that 1) is the right sentence.

저기 : there
거기 : there

It's easy to know '여기' and '저기', but there are also a word '거기' in Korean.
In English, '저기' and '거기' are translated as 'there'. What is the difference?

1.

It can be identified as the place of the speaker and listener.

'여기': a place close to the speaker

ex)
- 여기로 오세요. : Come here.
- 여기 앉으세요. : Sit down here.

'저기': a place far away from both the speaker and the listener.
In other words, the speaker and the listener are currently in the same place and talking about 'there(저기)' where is far from both speaker and listner.

ex)
- 저기에 뭐가 있어요? : What is there?
- 저기로 가요 : Let's go there.

'거기': A place close to the listener.
In other words, the speaker and the listener are not in the same place and are talking about the 'there(거기)' where the listener is.

ex)
- 거기는 날씨가 어때요? : What's the weather there?
- 거기에 어떻게 가요? : How can I get there?


2.

In addition, there is one more thing to know about '거기'.
We use '거기' when we talk about a place that was once mentioned during a conversation.

ex)
- 저기에 가 보세요. 거기에 물이 있어요. : Go over there. There's some water.
- 저기에서 기다리세요. 데니 씨가 거기로 갈 거예요. : Wait over there. Denny will be there.

- Indirect expression


You can speak your thoughts directly and strongly, but you can also express them indirectly.
In this case, the '~(으)ㄴ/는 것 같다' form, which means guess, can also be used to indirectly say my thoughts.

ex)

한국 음식 맛있는 것 같아요. (I think Korean food is yummy.)
한국 드라마 재미있는 것 같아요. (I think Korean drama is interesting.)
한국어 공부 쉬운 것 같아요. (I think learning Korean is easy.)

English speaking students usually say their thoughts, '저는 생각해요. blabla...'.
Because in English, they say 'I think blabla...'.
Of course we can understand that, but if you use the form '~(으)ㄴ/는 것 같다', you will be able to speak your thoughts in a more natural Korean language.


2.

- About negative answer


We'd learned to use '안' or '못' to make negative statements.
And we learned '~지 않아요' or '~지 못해요' in the same meaning.

However, depending on the situation, these negative statements could be too direct expression.

For example, if someone asks me and I say '못 해요' in the situation that I can't accept the request, it's too direct to be an excuse to the other person.
In this case, if you use '~(으)ㄹ 것 같아요', you can speak negative sentences more polite.

In other words,
'못 해요' -> '못 할 것 같아요'
'안 해요' -> '안 할 것 같아요'
could be a better expression.

ex)
"이따가 헬스장에 같이 가요."
"오늘 바빠서 못 갈 것 같아요."

"내일 아침 같이 먹어요."
"안 될 것 같아요."

The difference between '뭐' and '무슨' is not difficult.
'뭐' + Verb
'무슨' + Noun

Let's Take a look at the conversation below.

ex)

어제 뭐 했어요? // 뭐 + 하다(Verb)
공부했어요.
무슨 공부 했어요? // 무슨 + 공부(Noun)
한국어 공부 했어요.


2.

Now let's compare '무슨' and '어떤'.

'무슨 공부 했어요?'
'어떤 공부 했어요?'

In real life, the above two sentences are almost same.

However,

In more detail,
'무슨' is asking about what the object itself is.
'어떤' is asking about it's characteristics, content, and personality etc.

Therefore, depending on the situation, it may be necessary to distinguish between '무슨' and '어떤'.

For example,

'데니 씨는 무슨 사람이에요?'
'데니 씨는 어떤 사람이에요?'

Asking '무슨 사람' can be used in situations that you don't know who '데니 씨' is.
However, it is more natural to use '누구'(who) rather than '무슨 사람'.
Therefore, '데니 씨는 누구예요?' is correct.

In situations that you know already who '데니 씨' is and ask about his personality or characteristics, you should use '어떤'.


Let's take one more example.

'어제 본 영화 무슨 영화예요?'
'어제 본 영화 어떤 영화예요?'

If you look at the answer to the above sentence, it will be easy to understand.

'어제 본 영화 무슨 영화예요?' -> 'Lion king 이에요.'
'어제 본 영화 어떤 영화예요?' -> '재미있는 영화예요.'"

What's difference of 2 sentences above?
When translated into English, they are both 'will' or 'be going to'.
Therefore, students often misuse them.

The difference between the two is very simple.
- '~(으)ㄹ게요' : Promise between the speaker and the listener
- '~(으)ㄹ 거예요' : Only the speaker's plan, will / future tense

In other words, when using'~(으)ㄹ게요', it is natural in the situation where a consensus is formed between the speaker and the listener.
- ""조용히 좀 해주세요."" (Please be quiet.)
  ""미안해요. 밖에 나갈게요."" (I'm sorry. I'll go out.)
- ""지금 좀 바빠요."" (I'm a little busy now.)

- ""맛있게 드세요."" (Please enjoy this food.)
  ""고마워요. 잘 먹을게요."" (Thank you. I'll eat well.)

And when you want to express your will, such as a simple future or a new year goal, it is good to use '~(으)ㄹ 거예요' as follows..

- 새해에는 한국어를 열심히 공부할 거예요! (I'll study Korean hard in the new year!)

Both are correct sentences.

Then, Let's look at the next sentences.

1. 커피를 마시러 카페를 샀어요.
2. 커피를 마시려고 카페를 샀어요.

Only the verb changed '가다' to '샀다', but are both sentences correct again?

No.

1 is wrong and only 2 is correct now.
Why?


1.
In the previous lesson, the reason for saying '(으)러 가다' form instead of '(으)러' is
the only verbs that have the meaning of 'movement', such as  '가다', '오다', '올라가다' and '나오다', can be followed after '(으)러'.

In other words, the '(으)러' form is an expression to explain 'The reason of movement'.


2.
Let's look at the next sentences to see the second difference.

1. 커피를 마시러 카페에 갈 거예요.
2. 커피를 마시려고 카페에 갈 거예요.

Both sentences are used the future tense.
Now, which sentence is correct now?

The answer is no.1.

'(으)러' can be used in all past, present and future tense.
However, '(으)려고' can only be used in the past and present tense.
It cannot be used in the future tense.

In other words, '(으)려고' is an expression to explain 'The reason of the situation that has already occurred or is in progress'.

- 뭐 좀 먹을까요? = 뭐 좀 먹을래요?
- 이제 나갈까요? = 이제 나갈래요?


1. Common
Both expressions have the meaning of 'Shall we ~ together'.
So, you can use it with '같이' as below.

- 뭐 좀 (같이) 먹을까요? = 뭐 좀 (같이) 먹을래요?
- 이제 (같이) 나갈까요? = 이제 (같이) 나갈래요?


2. Difference: '~(으)ㄹ까요?'
'~(으)ㄹ까요?' is used to suggest my opinion to the other person. Let's take a look at the example again.

- 뭐 좀 먹을까요?
- 이제 나갈까요?

Likewise, depending on the situation, it could be 'I' not 'together'.

For example,
- 저는 너무 배고파요. (저) 먼저 뭐 좀 먹을까요? : I'm so hungry. Can I eat something first?
- 피곤해요? (저) 이제 나갈까요? :  Are you tired? Shall I go out now?


3. Difference: '~(으)ㄹ래요?'
'~(으)ㄹ래요?' is used to ask for the other person's opinion. Let's take a look at the example,

- 뭐 좀 먹을래요?
- 이제 나갈래요?

Depending on the situation, it could be 'only you' not 'together'.

For example,
- 배고파요? (너) 뭐 좀 먹을래요? : Are you hungry? Do you want to eat some food?
- 저 피곤해요. (너) 이제 나갈래요? : I'm tired. Can you go out now?


4. One more : '~(으)ㄹ래요.'
This time, I didn't write a question mark after '~(으)ㄹ래요'.
Because it is used when talking about my 'will' rather than asking for the other person's opinion.

So you can use it like this:
- 뭐 좀 먹을래요. : I'll eat something.
- 이제 나갈래요. : I'll go out now.
